# Comparative-Study-of-Black-Scholes-and-Binomial-Tree-Methods-for-Option-Pricing

• Analyzed key assumptions of the Black-Scholes model, including constant volatility,
lognormally distributed asset prices, no arbitrage, continuous trading, and frictionless
markets, and assessed their implications on model accuracy and limitations in real-world
scenarios.
• Implemented the Black-Scholes closed-form formula to price European call and put
options, incorporating inputs such as spot price, strike price, volatility, interest rate, and
time to maturity.
• Developed a multi-period Binomial Tree model to price European call and put options
using risk-neutral valuation and backward induction, and validated convergence behavior
by comparing results with analytical prices from the Black-Scholes model.
